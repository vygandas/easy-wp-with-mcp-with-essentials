AI Provider for OpenAI for the PHP AI Client SDK.

== Description ==

This plugin provides OpenAI integration for the PHP AI Client SDK. It enables WordPress sites to use OpenAI's GPT models for text generation, DALL-E for image generation, and other AI capabilities.

* Image generation with DALL-E models
* Function calling support
* Web search support

Available models are dynamically discovered from the OpenAI API, including GPT models for text generation, DALL-E and GPT Image models for image generation, and TTS models for text-to-speech.

**Requirements:**

* PHP 7.4 or higher
* For WordPress 6.9, the [wordpress/php-ai-client](https://github.com/WordPress/php-ai-client) package must be installed

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Configure your OpenAI API key via the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable or constant
